Che provides a persistent home directory feature that allows each non-ephemeral workspace to have their /home/user directory be persisted across workspace restarts. You can enable this feature in the CheCluster by setting spec.devEnvironments.persistUserHome.enabled to true. For newly started workspaces, this feature creates a PVC mounted to the /home/user path of the tools container. In this documentation, a \"tools container\" will be used to refer to the first container in the devfile. This container is the container that includes the project source code by default. When the PVC is mounted for the first time, the persistent volume’s content are empty and therefore must be populated with the /home/user directory content. By default, the persistUserHome feature creates an init container for each new workspace pod named init-persistent-home. This init container is created with the tools container image and is responsible for running a stow command to create symbolic links in the persistent volume to populate the /home/user directory. For files that cannot be symbolically linked to the /home/user directory such as the .viminfo and .bashrc file, cp is used instead of stow. The primary function of the stow command is to run: stow -t /home/user/ -d /home/tooling/ --no-folding The command above creates symbolic links in /home/user for files and directories located in /home/tooling. This populates the persistent volume with symbolic links to the content in /home/tooling. As a result, it the persistentUserHome feature expects the tooling image to have its /home/user/ content within /home/tooling. For example, if the tools container image contains files in the home/tooling directory such as .config and .config-folder/another-file, stow will create symbolic links in the persistent volume in the following manner: Figure 1. Tools container with persistUserHome enabled The init container writes the output of the stow command to /home/user/.stow.log and will only run stow the first time the persistent volume is mounted to the workspace. Using the stow command to populate /home/user content in the persistent volume provides two main advantages: Creating symbolic links is faster and consumes less storage than creating copies of the /home/user directory content in the persistent volume. To put it differently, the persistent volume in this case contains symbolic links and not the actual files themselves. If the tools image is updated with newer versions of existing binaries, configs, and files, the init container does not need to stow the new versions, as the existing symbolic links will link to the newer versions in /home/tooling already. If the tooling image is updated with additional binaries or files, they won’t be symbolically linked to the /home/user directory since the stow command won’t be run again. In this case, the user must delete the /home/user/.stow_completed file and restart the workspace to rerun stow. persistUserHome tools image requirements The persistUserHome depends on the tools image used for the workspace. By default Che uses the Universal Developer Image (UDI) for sample workspaces, which supports persistUserHome out of the box. If you are using a custom image, there are three requirements that should be met to support the persistUserHome feature. The tools image should contain stow version >= 2.4.0. The $HOME environment variable is set to /home/user. In the tools image, the directory that is intended to contain the /home/user content is /home/tooling. Due to requirement three, the default UDI image for example adds the /home/user content to /home/tooling instead, and runs: RUN stow -t /home/user/ -d /home/tooling/ --no-folding in the Dockerfile so that files in /home/tooling are accessible from /home/user even when not using the persistUserHome feature.","title":"Persistent user home","component":"docs","version":"7.99.x","name":"about-persistent-user-home","url":"/docs/stable/administration-guide/about-persistent-user-home/","titles":[],"keyword":"administration guide, about, che, persistent, user, home"},"2":{"id":2,"text":"You can configure Kubernetes Ingress labels and annotations, if your organization requires them.

While it is possible to manually collect logs from each running container, chectl provides commands which automate the process. Following commands are available to collect Eclipse Che logs from the Kubernetes cluster using the chectl tool: chectl server:logs Collects existing Eclipse Che server logs and stores them in a directory on the local machine. By default, logs are downloaded to a temporary directory on the machine. However, this can be overwritten by specifying the -d parameter. For example, to download Che logs to the /home/user/che-logs/ directory, use the command chectl server:logs -d /home/user/che-logs/ When run, chectl server:logs prints a message in the console specifying the directory that will store the log files: Eclipse Che logs will be available in '/tmp/chectl-logs/1648575098344' If Eclipse Che is installed in a non-default namespace, chectl server:logs requires the -n <NAMESPACE> paremeter, where <NAMESPACE> is the Kubernetes namespace or OpenShift project in which Eclipse Che was installed. For example, to get logs from Che in the my-namespace namespace, use the command chectl server:logs -n my-namespace chectl server:deploy Logs are automatically collected during the Che installation when installed using chectl.

Workspaces need special consideration when the autoscaler adds and removes nodes. When a new node is being added by the autoscaler, workspace startup can take longer than usual until the node provisioning is complete. Conversely when a node is being removed, ideally nodes that are running workspace pods should not be evicted by the autoscaler to avoid any interruptions while using the workspace and potentially losing any unsaved data. You need to make additional configurations to the Che installation to ensure proper workspace startup while a new node is being added.

However, Pods in the Che namespace must be able to communicate with Pods in user namespaces. Prerequisites The Kubernetes cluster has network restrictions such as multitenant isolation.

This can mean always returning true, or have more complex checks, for example, returning false when a connection property is missing. destroy() - cleanup method that is run before shutting down the telemetry backend. This method sends the WORKSPACE_STOPPED event. onActivity() - notifies that some activity is still happening for a given user. This is mainly used to send WORKSPACE_INACTIVE events. onEvent() - submits telemetry events to the telemetry server, such as WORKSPACE_USED or WORKSPACE_STARTED. increaseDuration() - increases the duration of a current event rather than sending many events in a small frame of time. The following sections cover: Creating a telemetry server to echo events to standard output. Extending the Che telemetry client and implementing a user’s custom backend. Creating a plugin.yaml file representing a DevWorkspace plugin for the custom backend. Specifying of a location of a custom plugin to Che by setting the workspacesDefaultPlugins attribute from the CheCluster custom resource. This document describes the steps required to extend the Che telemetry system to communicate with to a custom backend: Creating a server process that receives events Extending Che libraries to create a backend that sends events to the server Packaging the telemetry backend in a container and deploying it to an image registry Adding a plugin for your backend and instructing Che to load the plugin in your DevWorkspaces A finished example of the telemetry backend is available here. For demonstration purposes, this example shows how to create a server that receives events from our telemetry plugin and writes them to standard output. For production use cases, consider integrating with a third-party telemetry system (for example, Segment, Woopra) rather than creating your own telemetry server. In this case, use your provider’s APIs to send events from your custom backend to their system. The following Go code starts a server on port 8080 and writes events to standard output: Example 1. main.go package main import ( \"io/ioutil\" \"net/http\" \"go.uber.org/zap\" ) var logger *zap.SugaredLogger func event(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { switch req.Method { case \"GET\": logger.Info(\"GET /event\") case \"POST\": logger.Info(\"POST /event\") } body, err := req.GetBody() if err != nil { logger.With(\"err\", err).Info(\"error getting body\") return } responseBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body) if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error reading response body\") return } logger.With(\"body\", string(responseBody)).Info(\"got event\") } func activity(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { switch req.Method { case \"GET\": logger.Info(\"GET /activity, doing nothing\") case \"POST\": logger.Info(\"POST /activity\") body, err := req.GetBody() if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error getting body\") return } responseBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body) if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error reading response body\") return } logger.With(\"body\", string(responseBody)).Info(\"got activity\") } } func main() { log, _ := zap.NewProduction() logger = log.Sugar() http.HandleFunc(\"/event\", event) http.HandleFunc(\"/activity\", activity) logger.Info(\"Added Handlers\") logger.Info(\"Starting to serve\") http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil) } Create a container image based on this code and expose it as a deployment in OpenShift in the eclipse-che namespace. The code for the example telemetry server is available at telemetry-server-example. To deploy the telemetry server, clone the repository and build the container: $ git clone https://github.com/che-incubator/telemetry-server-example $ cd telemetry-server-example $ docker build -t registry/organization/telemetry-server-example:latest . $ docker push registry/organization/telemetry-server-example:latest Both manifest_with_ingress.yaml and manifest_with_route contain definitions for a Deployment and Service. The former also defines a Kubernetes Ingress, while the latter defines an OpenShift Route. In the manifest file, replace the image and host fields to match the image you pushed, and the public hostname of your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. Then run: $ kubectl apply -f manifest_with_[ingress|route].yaml -n eclipse-che For fast feedback when developing, it is recommended to do development inside a DevWorkspace. This way, you can run the application in a cluster and receive events from the front-end telemetry plugin.

Run the following command within a DevWorkspace’s terminal window to start the application. Use the --settings flag to specify path to the location of the settings.xml file that contains the GitHub access token. $ mvn --settings=settings.xml quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.port=${DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT} The application now receives telemetry events through port 4167 from the front-end plugin.

Example 7. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public boolean isEnabled() { return true; } It is possible to put more complex logic in isEnabled(). For example, the hosted Che Woopra backend checks that a configuration property exists before determining if the backend is enabled. onEvent() sends the event received by the backend to the telemetry system. For the example application, it sends an HTTP POST payload to the /event endpoint from the telemetry server. For the following example, the telemetry server application is deployed to OpenShift at the following URL: http://little-telemetry-server-che.apps-crc.testing, where apps-crc.testing is the ingress domain name of the OpenShift cluster. Set up the RESTEasy REST Client by creating TelemetryService.java Example 8. TelemetryService.java package org.my.group; import java.util.Map; import javax.ws.rs.Consumes; import javax.ws.rs.POST; import javax.ws.rs.Path; import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType; import javax.ws.rs.core.Response; import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient; @RegisterRestClient public interface TelemetryService { @POST @Path(\"/event\") (1) @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) Response sendEvent(Map<String, Object> payload); } 1 The endpoint to make the POST request to. Specify the base URL for TelemetryService in the src/main/resources/application.properties file: Example 9. application.properties org.my.group.TelemetryService/mp-rest/url=http://little-telemetry-server-che.apps-crc.testing Inject TelemetryService into AnalyticsManager and send a POST request in onEvent() Example 10. AnalyticsManager.java @Dependent @Alternative public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { @Inject @RestClient TelemetryService telemetryService; ... @Override public void onEvent(AnalyticsEvent event, String ownerId, String ip, String userAgent, String resolution, Map<String, Object> properties) { Map<String, Object> payload = new HashMap<String, Object>(properties); payload.put(\"event\", event); telemetryService.sendEvent(payload); } This sends an HTTP request to the telemetry server and automatically delays identical events for a small period of time. The default duration is 1500 milliseconds. Many telemetry systems recognize event duration. The AbstractAnalyticsManager merges similar events that happen in the same frame of time into one event. This implementation of increaseDuration() is a no-op. This method uses the APIs of the user’s telemetry provider to alter the event or event properties to reflect the increased duration of an event. Example 11. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void increaseDuration(AnalyticsEvent event, Map<String, Object> properties) {} Set an inactive timeout limit, and use onActivity() to send a WORKSPACE_INACTIVE event if the last event time is longer than the timeout. Example 12. AnalyticsManager.java public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { ... private long inactiveTimeLimit = 60000 * 3; ... @Override public void onActivity() { if (System.currentTimeMillis() - lastEventTime >= inactiveTimeLimit) { onEvent(WORKSPACE_INACTIVE, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } } When destroy() is called, send a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event and shutdown any resources such as connection pools. Example 13. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void destroy() { onEvent(WORKSPACE_STOPPED, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } Running mvn quarkus:dev as described in Running the application within a DevWorkspace and terminating the application with Ctrl+C sends a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event to the server. See the Quarkus documentation for the best instructions to package the application in a container. Build and push the container to a container registry of your choice. Example 14.

After startup, the editor checks for this environment variable, and if it is specified, takes the path to the extensions and installs it in the background without disturbing the user. Configuring default extensions is useful for installing .vsix extensions from the editor level. If you want to specify multiple extensions, separate them by semicolon. DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS='/projects/extension-1.vsix;/projects/extension-2.vsix' Read on to learn how to define the DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS environment variable, including multiple examples of adding .vsix files to your workspace. There are three different ways to embed default .vsix extensions into your workspace: Put the extension binary into the source repository. Use the devfile postStart event to fetch extension binaries from the network. Include the extensions' .vsix binaries in the che-code image. Putting the extension binary into the source repository Putting the extension binary into the Git repository and defining the environment variable in the devfile is the easiest way to add default extensions to your workspace. If the extension.vsix file exists in the repository root, you can set the DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS for a tooling container. Procedure Specify DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS in your .devfile.yaml as shown in the following example: schemaVersion: 2.3.0 metadata: generateName: example-project components: - name: tools container: image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest env: - name: 'DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS' value: '/projects/example-project/extension.vsix' Using the devfile postStart event to fetch extension binaries from the network You can use cURL or GNU Wget to download extensions to your workspace. For that you need to: specify a devfile command to download extensions to your workpace add a postStart event to run the command on workspace startup define the DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS environment variable in the devfile Procedure Add the values shown in the following example to the devfile: schemaVersion: 2.3.0 metadata: generateName: example-project components: - name: tools container: image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest env: - name: DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS value: '/tmp/extension-1.vsix;/tmp/extension-2.vsix' commands: - id: add-default-extensions exec: # name of the tooling container component: tools # download several extensions using curl commandLine: | curl https://.../extension-1.vsix --location -o /tmp/extension-1.vsix curl https://.../extension-2.vsix --location -o /tmp/extension-2.vsix events: postStart: - add-default-extensions In some cases curl may download a .gzip compressed file. This might make installing the extension impossible. To fix that try to save the file as a .vsix.gz file and then decompress it with gunzip. This will replace the .vsix.gz file with an unpacked .vsix file. curl https://some-extension-url --location -o /tmp/extension.vsix.gz gunzip /tmp/extension.vsix.gz Including the extensions .vsix binaries in the che-code image. With default extensions bundled in the editor image, and the DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS environment variable defined in the ConfigMap, you can apply the default extensions without changing the devfile. Following the steps below to add the extensions you need to the editor image. Procedure Create a directory and place your selected .vsix extensions in this directory. Create a Dockerfile with the following content: # inherit che-incubator/che-code:latest FROM quay.io/che-incubator/che-code:latest USER 0 # copy all .vsix files to /default-extensions directory RUN mkdir --mode=775 /default-extensions COPY --chmod=755 *.vsix /default-extensions/ # add instruction to the script to copy default extensions to the working container RUN echo \"cp -r /default-extensions /checode/\" >> /entrypoint-init-container.sh Build the image and then push it to a registry: $ docker build -t yourname/che-code:next . $ docker push yourname/che-code:next Add the new ConfigMap to the user’s namespace, define the DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS environment variable, and specify the absolute paths to the extensions.

Using https://open-vsx.org is not recommended in an air-gapped environment, isolated from the internet. In order to reduce the risk of malware infections and unauthorized access to your code use the embedded or self-hosted Open VSX registry with the curated set of extensions. To select the embedded Open VSX registry instance in the plugin-registry pod, use openVSXURL: ''. You can customize the list of included extensions. You can also point openVSXURL at the URL of a standalone Open VSX registry instance if its URL is accessible from within your organization’s cluster and not blocked by a proxy. You can add or remove extensions in the embedded Open VSX registry instance. This results in a custom build of the Open VSX registry that can be used in your organization’s workspaces. To get the latest security fixes after a Che update, rebuild your container based on the latest tag or SHA. Procedure Get the publisher and extension name of each chosen extension: Find the extension on the Open VSX registry website and copy the URL of the extension’s listing page and extension’s version. Extract the <publisher> and <extension> name from the copied URL: https://open-vsx.org/extension/<publisher>/<name> If the extension is only available from Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace, but not Open VSX, you can ask the extension publisher to also publish it on open-vsx.org according to these instructions, potentially using this GitHub action. If the extension publisher is unavailable or unwilling to publish the extension to open-vsx.org, and if there is no Open VSX equivalent of the extension, consider reporting an issue to the Open VSX team. Build the custom plugin registry image and update CheCluster custom resource: During the build process, each extension will be verified for compatibility with the version of Visual Studio Code used in Che. Using Che instance: Login to your Che instance as an administrator. Start a workspace using the plugin registry repository. Open a terminal and check out the Git tag that corresponds to your Che version (e.g., 7.87.0): git checkout $PRODUCT_VERSION Open the che-plugin-registry/openvsx-sync.json file and add or remove extensions. Execute 1. Build and Publish a Custom Plugin Registry task in the workspace (Terminal → Run Task…​ → devfile → 1. Build and Publish a Custom Plugin Registry). Execute 2. Configure Che to use the Custom Plugin Registry task in the workspace (Terminal → Run Task…​ → devfile → 2. Configure Che to use the Custom Plugin Registry). Using Linux operating system: Podman and NodeJS version 18.20.3 or higher should be installed in the system. Download or fork and clone the plugin registry repository. For each extension that you need to add or remove, edit the openvsx-sync.json file: To add extensions, add the publisher, name and extension version to the openvsx-sync.json file. To remove extensions, remove the publisher, name and extension version from the openvsx-sync.json file. Use the following JSON syntax: { \"id\": \"<publisher>.<name>\", \"version\": \"<extension_version>\" } If you have a closed-source extension or an extension developed only for internal use in your organization, you can add the extension directly from a .vsix file by using a URL accessible to your custom plugin registry container: { \"id\": \"<publisher>.<name>\", \"download\": \"<url_to_download_vsix_file>\", \"version\": \"<extension_version>\" } Read the Terms of Use for the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace before using its resources.

The ConfigMaps can have an arbitrary amount of keys with a random amount of certificates each. Operator merges all ConfigMaps into a single one titled ca-certs-merged, and mounts it as a volume in the Che server, dashboard and workspace pods. By default, the Operator mounts the ca-certs-merged ConfigMap in a user’s workspace at two locations: /public-certs and /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem. The /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem directory is where the system stores extracted CA certificates for trusted certificate authorities on Red Hat (e.g., CentOS, Fedora). CLI tools automatically use certificates from the system-trusted locations, when the user’s workspace is up and running. When an OpenShift cluster contains cluster-wide trusted CA certificates added through the cluster-wide-proxy configuration, Che Operator detects them and automatically injects them into a ConfigMap with the config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=\"true\" label.

See Getting started with the OpenShift CLI. For a repeat installation on the same OpenShift cluster: you uninstalled the previous Che instance according to Uninstalling Che. Procedure In the Administrator view of the OpenShift web console, go to Operators → OperatorHub and search for Eclipse Che. Install the Eclipse Che Operator. See Installing from OperatorHub using the web console. The Eclipse Che Operator depends on the DevWorkspace Operator. If you install the Eclipse Che Operator manually to a non-default namespace, ensure that the DevWorkspace Operator is also installed in the same namespace. This is required as the Operator Lifecycle Manager will attempt to install the DevWorkspace Operator as a dependency within the Eclipse Che Operator namespace, potentially resulting in two conflicting installations of the DevWorkspace Operator if the latter is installed in a different namespace. If you want to onboard Web Terminal Operator on the cluster make sure to use the same installation namespace as Eclipse Che Operator since both depend on DevWorkspace Operator. Web Terminal Operator, Eclipse Che Operator, and DevWorkspace Operator must be installed in the same namespace. Create the eclipse-che project in OpenShift as follows: oc create namespace eclipse-che Go to Operators → Installed Operators → Eclipse Che instance Specification → Create CheCluster → YAML view. In the YAML view, replace namespace: openshift-operators with namespace: eclipse-che. Select Create. See Creating applications from installed Operators. Verification In Eclipse Che instance Specification, go to eclipse-che, landing on the Details tab. Under Message, check that there is None, which means no errors. Under Eclipse Che URL, wait until the URL of the Che instance appears, and then open the URL to check the Che dashboard.

Compared to fully separate \"real\" clusters, virtual clusters reuse worker nodes and networking of the host cluster. They have their own control plane and schedule all workloads into a single namespace of the host cluster. Similar to virtual machines, virtual clusters partition a single physical cluster into multiple separate ones. vCluster offers a solution for deploying Che in scenarios where it normally would be impossible. This includes situations where the Kubernetes cluster version is incompatible with Che, or when the cloud service provider lacks support for external OIDC. Utilizing vClusters allows bypassing these constraints and enables Che to function as needed. Prerequisites helm: The package manager for Kubernetes.

Eclipse Che runs on top of OpenShift, which provides the platform, and the foundation for the products functioning on top of it. OpenShift documentation is the entry point for security hardening. Project isolation in OpenShift In OpenShift, project isolation is similar to namespace isolation in Kubernetes but is achieved through the concept of projects. A project in OpenShift is a top-level organizational unit that provides isolation and collaboration between different applications, teams, or workloads within a cluster. By default, Che provisions a unique <username>-devspaces project for each user. Alternatively, the cluster administrator can disable project self-provisioning on the OpenShift level, and turn off automatic namespace provisioning in the CheCluster custom resource: devEnvironments: defaultNamespace: autoProvision: false With this setup, you achieve a curated access to Che, where cluster administrators control provisioning for each user and can explicitly configure various settings including resource limits and quotas. Learn more about project provisioning in the Provisioning namespaces in advance. Role-based access control (RBAC) By default, the Che operator creates the following ClusterRoles: <namespace>-cheworkspaces-clusterrole <namespace>-cheworkspaces-devworkspace-clusterrole The <namespace> prefix corresponds to the project name where the Eclipse Che CheCluster CR is located. The first time a user accesses Eclipse Che, the corresponding RoleBinding is created in the <username>-devspaces project. All resources and actions you can grant users permission to use in their namespace is listed below. Table 1. Overview of resources and actions available in a user’s namespace. Resources Actions pods \"get\", \"list\", \"watch\", \"create\", \"delete\", \"update\", \"patch\" pods/exec \"get\", \"create\" pods/log \"get\", \"list\", \"watch\" pods/portforward \"get\", \"list\", \"create\" configmaps \"get\", \"list\", \"create\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\" events \"list\", \"watch\" secrets \"get\", \"list\", \"create\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\" services \"get\", \"list\", \"create\", \"delete\", \"update\", \"patch\" routes \"get\", \"list\", \"create\", \"delete\" persistentvolumeclaims \"get\", \"list\", \"watch\", \"create\", \"delete\", \"update\", \"patch\" apps/deployments \"get\", \"list\", \"watch\", \"create\", \"patch\", \"delete\" apps/replicasets \"get\", \"list\", \"patch\", \"delete\" namespaces \"get\", \"list\" projects \"get\" devworkspace \"get\", \"create\", \"delete\", \"list\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"watch\" devworkspacetemplates \"get\", \"create\", \"delete\", \"list\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"watch\" Each user is granted permissions only to their namespace, and can not access other user’s resources. Cluster administrators can add extra permissions to users. They should not remove permissions granted by default. Refer to the product documentation for configuring cluster roles for Eclipse Che users. More details about the role-based access control are available in the OpenShift documentation. Dev environment isolation Isolation of the development environments is implemented using OpenShift projects. Every developer has a project in which the following objects are created and managed: Cloud Development Environment (CDE) Pods, including the IDE server. Secrets containing developer credentials, such as a Git token, SSH keys, and a Kubernetes token. ConfigMaps with developer-specific configuration, such as the Git name and email. Volumes that persist data such as the source code, even when the CDE Pod is stopped. Access to the resources in a namespace must be limited to the developer owning it. Granting read access to another developer is equivalent to sharing the developer credentials and should be avoided. Enhanced authorization The current trend is to split an infrastructure into several \"fit for purpose\" clusters instead of having a gigantic monolith OpenShift cluster. However, administrators might still want to provide granular access, and restrict the availability of certain functionalities to particular users. A \"fit for purpose\" OpenShift cluster refers to a cluster that is specifically designed and configured to meet the requirements and goals of a particular use case or workload. It is tailored to optimize performance, resource utilization, and other factors based on the characteristics of the workloads it will be managing. For Eclipse Che, it is recommended to have this type of cluster provisioned. For this purpose, optional properties that you can use to set up granular access for different groups and users are available in the CheCluster Custom Resource: allowUsers allowGroups denyUsers denyGroups Below is an example of access configuration: networking: auth: advancedAuthorization: allowUsers: - user-a - user-b denyUsers: - user-c allowGroups: - openshift-group-a - openshift-group-b denyGroups: - openshift-group-c Users in the denyUsers and denyGroup categories will not be able to use Eclipse Che and will see a warning when trying to access the User Dashboard. Authentication Only authenticated OpenShift users can access Eclipse Che. The Gateway Pod uses a role-based access control (RBAC) subsystem to determine whether a developer is authorized to access a Cloud Development Environment (CDE) or not. The CDE Gateway container checks the developer’s Kubernetes roles. If their roles allow access to the CDE Pod, the connection to the development environment is allowed. By default, only the owner of the namespace has access to the CDE Pod. Access to the resources in a namespace must be limited to the developer owning it. Granting read access to another developer is equivalent to sharing the developer credentials and should be avoided. Security context and security context constraint Eclipse Che adds SETGID and SETUID capabilities to the specification of the CDE Pod container security context: \"spec\": { \"containers\": [ \"securityContext\": { \"allowPrivilegeEscalation\": true, \"capabilities\": { \"add\": [\"SETGID\", \"SETUID\"], \"drop\": [\"ALL\",\"KILL\",\"MKNOD\"] }, \"readOnlyRootFilesystem\": false, \"runAsNonRoot\": true, \"runAsUser\": 1001110000 } ] } This provides the ability for users to build container images from within a CDE. By default, Eclipse Che assigns a specific SecurityContextConstraint (SCC) to the users that allows them to start a Pod with such capabilities. This SCC grants more capabilities to the users compared to the default restricted SCC but less capability compared to the anyuid SCC. This default SCC is pre-created in the Che namespace and named container-build. Setting the following property in the CheCluster Custom Resource prevents assigning extra capabilities and SCC to users: spec: devEnvironments: disableContainerBuildCapabilities: true Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges are Kubernetes features you can use to help prevent bad actors and resource abuse within a cluster. Specifically, they allow you to set resource consumption constraints for pods and containers. By combining Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges, you can enforce project-specific policies to prevent bad actors from consuming excessive resources. These mechanisms contribute to better resource management, stability, and fairness within an OpenShift cluster. More details about Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges are available in the OpenShift documentation. Disconnected environment An air-gapped OpenShift disconnected cluster refers to an OpenShift cluster isolated from the internet or any external network. This isolation is often done for security reasons to protect sensitive or critical systems from potential cyber threats. In an air-gapped environment, the cluster cannot access external repositories or registries to download container images, updates, or dependencies. Eclipse Che is supported and can be installed in a restricted environment. Installation instructions are available in the official documentation. Managing extensions By default, Eclipse Che includes the embedded Open VSX registry which contains a limited set of extensions for the Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source editor. Alternatively, cluster administrators can specify a different plugin registry in the Custom Resource, e.g. https://open-vsx.org that contains thousands of extensions. They can also build a custom Open VSX registry. More details about managing IDE extensions are available in the official documentation. Installing extra extensions increases potential risks. To minimize these risks, make sure to only install extensions from reliable sources and regularly update them. Secrets Keep sensitive data stored as Kubernetes secrets in the users’ namespaces confidential (e.g. Personal Access Tokens (PAT), and SSH keys). Git repositories It is crucial to operate within Git repositories that you are familiar with and that you trust. Before incorporating new dependencies into the repository, verify that they are well-maintained and regularly release updates to address any identified security vulnerabilities in their code.","title":"Security best practices for Eclipse Che","component":"docs","version":"7.99.x","name":"security-best-practices","url":"/docs/stable/administration-guide/security-best-practices/","titles":[],"keyword":"security, best practices"},"106":{"id":106,"text":"The Che server components ensure multi-tenancy and workspaces management.

Procedure Use the pod-overrides attribute to add the required annotations defined in Configuring fuse-overlayfs to the workspace. The pod-overrides attribute allows merging certain fields in the workspace pod’s spec. For OpenShift versions older than 4.15: $ kubectl patch devworkspace <DevWorkspace_name> \\ --patch '{\"spec\":{\"template\":{\"attributes\":{\"pod-overrides\":{\"metadata\":{\"annotations\":{\"io.kubernetes.cri-o.Devices\":\"/dev/fuse\",\"io.openshift.podman-fuse\":\"\"}}}}}}}' \\ --type=merge For OpenShift version 4.15 and later: $ kubectl patch devworkspace <DevWorkspace_name> \\ --patch '{\"spec\":{\"template\":{\"attributes\":{\"pod-overrides\":{\"metadata\":{\"annotations\":{\"io.kubernetes.cri-o.Devices\":\"/dev/fuse\"}}}}}}}' \\ --type=merge Verification steps Start the workspace and verify that /dev/fuse is available in the workspace container. $ stat /dev/fuse After completing this procedure, follow the steps in Enabling fuse-overlayfs with a Configmap to use fuse-overlayfs for Podman.","title":"Accessing /dev/fuse from a workspace","component":"docs","version":"7.99.x","name":"accessing-fuse","url":"/docs/stable/end-user-guide/accessing-fuse/","titles":[],"keyword":"user-guide, fuse, overlay, device, /dev/fuse, pod, overrides"},"122":{"id":122,"text":"In a workspace, you can run Git commands that require user authentication like cloning a remote private Git repository or pushing to a remote public or private Git repository.

To do so, use the che-editor.yaml file. This file supports even a detailed IDE configuration. If you intend to start most or all of your organization’s workspaces with the same IDE other than Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source, an alternative is for the administrator of your organization’s Che instance to specify another supported IDE as the default IDE at the Che instance level. This can be done with .spec.devEnvironments.defaultEditor in the CheCluster Custom Resource. By using the che-editor.yaml file, you can set a common default IDE for your team and provide new contributors with the most suitable IDE for your project source code. You can also use the che-editor.yaml file when you need to set a different IDE default for a particular source code Git repository rather than the default IDE of your organization’s Che instance. Procedure In the remote Git repository of your project source code, create a /.che/che-editor.yaml file with lines that specify the relevant parameter. Verification Start a new workspace with a clone of the Git repository. Verify that the specified IDE loads in the browser tab of the started workspace. The simplest way to select an IDE in the che-editor.yaml is to specify the id of an IDE from the table of supported IDEs: Table 1.

For production purposes, it is recommended to use one of the Universal Base Images as a base image for defining the Cloud Development Environment.

As a result, if there is a workspace named my-workspace in the Che dashboard, there is a corresponding DevWorkspace custom resource named my-workspace in the user’s namespace on the cluster. Because each DevWorkspace custom resource on the cluster represents a Che workspace, you can manage Che workspaces by using Kubernetes APIs with clients such as the command-line kubectl. Each DevWorkspace custom resource contains details derived from the devfile of the Git repository cloned for the workspace. For example, a devfile might provide devfile commands and workspace container configurations. As a user, you can list your workspaces by using the command line. Prerequisites An active kubectl session with permissions to get the DevWorkspace resources in your namespace on the cluster. See Overview of kubectl. You know the relevant Che user namespace on the cluster. You can visit https://<che_fqdn>/api/kubernetes/namespace to get your Che user namespace as name. You are in the Che user namespace on the cluster. On OpenShift, you can use the command-line oc tool to display your current namespace or switch to a namespace. Procedure To list your workspaces, enter the following on a command line: $ kubectl get devworkspaces Example 1.

Users with administrative permissions on the cluster can list all workspaces from all Che users by including the --all-namespaces flag. If your use case does not permit use of the Che dashboard, you can create workspaces with Kubernetes APIs by applying custom resources to the cluster. Creating workspaces through the Che dashboard provides better user experience and configuration benefits compared to using the command line: As a user, you are automatically logged in to the cluster. Kubernetes or OpenShift clients work automatically. Che and its components automatically convert the target Git repository’s devfile into the DevWorkspace and DevWorkspaceTemplate custom resources on the cluster. Access to the workspace is secured by default with the routingClass: che in the DevWorkspace of the workspace. Recognition of the DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig configuration is managed by Che. Recognition of configurations in spec.devEnvironments specified in the CheCluster custom resource including: Persistent storage strategy is specified with devEnvironments.storage. Default IDE is specified with devEnvironments.defaultEditor. Default plugins are specified with devEnvironments.defaultPlugins. Container build configuration is specified with devEnvironments.containerBuildConfiguration. Prerequisites An active kubectl session with permissions to create DevWorkspace resources in your namespace on the cluster. See Overview of kubectl. You know the relevant Che user namespace on the cluster. You can visit https://<che_fqdn>/api/kubernetes/namespace to get your Che user namespace as name. You are in the Che user namespace on the cluster. On OpenShift, you can use the command-line oc tool to display your current namespace or switch to a namespace. Che administrators who intend to create workspaces for other users must create the DevWorkspace custom resource in a user namespace that is provisioned by Che or by the administrator. See Configuring user namespace provisioning. Procedure To prepare the DevWorkspace custom resource, copy the contents of the target Git repository’s devfile. Example 2.

Add a volumeMount for the relevant container in the devfile: ... components: - name: ... container: ... volumeMounts: - name: <chosen_volume_name_from_previous_step> path: <path_where_to_mount_the_PV> ... Example 1. A devfile that provisions a PV for a workspace to a container When a workspace is started with the following devfile, the cache PV is provisioned to the golang container in the ./cache container path: schemaVersion: 2.1.0 metadata: name: mydevfile components: - name: golang container: image: golang memoryLimit: 512Mi mountSources: true command: ['sleep', 'infinity'] volumeMounts: - name: cache path: /.cache - name: cache volume: size: 2Gi You can opt to apply a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to request a PersistentVolume (PV) for your workspaces in the following cases: Not all developers of the project need the PV. The PV lifecycle goes beyond the lifecycle of a single workspace. The data included in the PV are shared across workspaces. You can apply a PVC to the DevWorkspace containers even if the workspace is ephemeral and its devfile contains the controller.devfile.io/storage-type: ephemeral attribute. Prerequisites You have not started the workspace. An active kubectl session with administrative permissions to the destination Kubernetes cluster. See Overview of kubectl. A PVC is created in your user namespace to mount to all DevWorkspace containers. Procedure Add the controller.devfile.io/mount-to-devworkspace: true label to the PVC. $ kubectl label persistentvolumeclaim <PVC_name> \\ controller.devfile.io/mount-to-devworkspace=true Optional: Use the annotations to configure how the PVC is mounted: Table 1. Optional annotations Annotation Description controller.devfile.io/mount-path: The mount path for the PVC. Defaults to /tmp/<PVC_name>. controller.devfile.io/read-only: Set to 'true' or 'false' to specify whether the PVC is to be mounted as read-only. Defaults to 'false', resulting in the PVC mounted as read/write. Example 2. Mounting a read-only PVC apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: <pvc_name> labels: controller.devfile.io/mount-to-devworkspace: 'true' annotations: controller.devfile.io/mount-path: </example/directory> (1) controller.devfile.io/read-only: 'true' spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 3Gi (2) storageClassName: <storage_class_name> (3) volumeMode: Filesystem 1 The mounted PV is available at </example/directory> in the workspace. 2 Example size value of the requested storage. 3 The name of the StorageClass required by the claim.

Tuning can reduce this start time. Depending on the options, administrators or users can do the tuning. This section includes several tuning options for starting workspaces faster or improving workspace runtime performance. Caching images with Image Puller Role: Administrator When starting a workspace, Kubernetes pulls the images from the registry. A workspace can include many containers meaning that Kubernetes pulls Pod’s images (one per container). Depending on the size of the image and the bandwidth, it can take a long time. Image Puller is a tool that can cache images on each of Kubernetes nodes. As such, pre-pulling images can improve start times. See Caching images for faster workspace start. Choosing better storage type Role: Administrator and user Every workspace has a shared volume attached. This volume stores the project files, so that when restarting a workspace, changes are still available. Depending on the storage, attach time can take up to a few minutes, and I/O can be slow. Installing offline Role: Administrator Components of Che are OCI images. Set up Eclipse Che in offline mode to reduce any extra download at runtime because everything needs to be available from the beginning. See Installing Che in a restricted environment on OpenShift. Reducing the number of public endpoints Role: Administrator For each endpoint, Kubernetes is creating Kubernetes Ingress or OpenShift Route objects. Depending on the underlying configuration, this creation can be slow. To avoid this problem, reduce the exposure. For example, to automatically detect a new port listening inside containers and redirect traffic for the processes using a local IP address (127.0.0.1), Microsoft Visual Code - Open Source has three optional routes. By reducing the number of endpoints and checking endpoints of all plugins, workspace start can be faster. Providing enough CPU resources Plugins consume CPU resources. For example, when a plugin provides IntelliSense features, adding more CPU resources can improve performance. Ensure the CPU settings in the devfile definition, devfile.yaml, are correct: components: - name: tools container: image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest cpuLimit: 4000m (1) cpuRequest: 1000m (2) 1 Specifies the CPU limit 2 Specifies the CPU request Providing enough memory Plug-ins consume CPU and memory resources. For example, when a plugin provides IntelliSense features, collecting data can consume all the memory allocated to the container. Providing more memory to the container can increase performance. Ensure that memory settings in the devfile definition devfile.yaml file are correct. components: - name: tools container: image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest memoryLimit: 6G (1) memoryRequest: 512Mi (2) 1 Specifies the memory limit 2 Specifies the memory request","title":"Troubleshooting slow workspaces","component":"docs","version":"7.99.x","name":"troubleshooting-slow-workspaces","url":"/docs/stable/end-user-guide/troubleshooting-slow-workspaces/","titles":[{"text":"Improving workspace start time","hash":"improving-workspace-start-time","id":1},{"text":"Improving workspace runtime performance","hash":"improving-workspace-runtime-performance","id":2}],"keyword":"user-guide, troubleshooting-slow-workspaces"},"159":{"id":159,"text":"If you use Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source in a private browsing window, you might encounter the following error message: Error loading webview: Error: Could not register service workers.

The action achieves this by listening to pull request events and providing a factory URL by creating a comment, a status check, or both. This factory URL creates a new workspace from the pull request branch on Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat. The Che documentation repository (https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs) is a real-life example where the Try in Web IDE GitHub action helps reviewers quickly test pull requests. Experience the workflow by navigating to a recent pull request and opening a factory URL. Figure 1. Pull request comment created by the Try in Web IDE GitHub action.

The workflow is triggered on the pull_request_target event, on the opened activity type. Optionally configure the activity types from the on.pull_request_target.types field to customize when workflow trigger. Activity types such as reopened and synchronize can be useful. Example 2. Triggering the workflow on both opened and synchronize activity types on: pull_request_target: types: [opened, synchronize] Optionally configure the add_comment and add_status GitHub action inputs within example.yml. These inputs are sent to the Try in Web IDE GitHub action to customize whether comments and status checks are to be made.

If your administrator could not configure it for Che users, the workaround is for you to use a personal access token. You can configure personal access tokens on the User Preferences page of your Che dashboard: https://<che_fqdn>/dashboard/#/user-preferences?tab=personal-access-tokens, or apply it manually as a Kubernetes Secret in the namespace. Mounting your access token as a Secret enables the Che Server to access the remote repository that is cloned during workspace creation, including access to the repository’s /.che and /.vscode folders. Apply the Secret in your user namespace of the Kubernetes cluster of your organization’s Che instance. After applying the Secret, you can create workspaces with clones of private Git repositories that are hosted on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Server, or Microsoft Azure Repos. You can create and apply multiple access-token Secrets per Git provider. You must apply each of those Secrets in your user namespace. Prerequisites You have logged in to the cluster. On OpenShift, you can use the oc command-line tool to log in to the cluster: $ oc login https://<che_fqdn> --username=<my_user> Procedure Generate your access token on your Git provider’s website. Personal access tokens are sensitive information and should be kept confidential. Treat them like passwords. If you are having trouble with authentication, ensure you are using the correct token and have the appropriate permissions for cloning repositories: Open a terminal locally on your computer Use the git command to clone the repository using your personal access token. The format of the git command vary based on the Git Provider. As an example, GitHub personal access token verification can be done using the following command: git clone https://<PAT>@github.com/username/repo.git Replace <PAT> with your personal access token, and username/repo with the appropriate repository path. If the token is valid and has the necessary permissions, the cloning process should be successful. Otherwise, this is an indicator of incorrect personal access token, insufficient permissions, or other issues. For GitHub Enterprise Cloud, verify that the token is authorized for use within the organization. Go to https://<che_fqdn>/api/user/id in the web browser to get your Che user ID.

Community meetings Join us in the Che community meeting, available on-demand. Roadmap See the development roadmap on the wiki. Eclipse Che is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform. As an open source project, the core goals of Eclipse Che are to: Accelerate project and developer onboarding: As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, Eclipse Che makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project. Remove inconsistency between developer environments: No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment. Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness: As Eclipse Che becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines. To achieve those core goals, Eclipse Che provides: Workspaces: Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications. Browser-based IDEs: Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tools, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more. Extensible platform: Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plugins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions. Enterprise Integration: Multiuser capabilities with OIDC authentication. Che defines the workspace to be the project code files and all the dependencies necessary to edit, build, run, and debug them. Che treats the IDE and the development runtime as dependencies of the workspace. These items are embedded and always included with the workspace. This differentiates Che from classical workspace definitions, which can include the project code, but require the developer to bind their IDE to their workstation and use it to provide a runtime locally. Workspaces are isolated from one another and are responsible for managing the lifecycle of their components. Developers using Eclipse Che use their containers directly in their developer workspaces. Che workspaces are Kubernetes or OpenShift Pods, which allow to replicate the application runtimes (and its microservices) used in production and provide a “developer mode” layer on top of those, adding intelligent code completion and IDE tools. An enterprise integration using OpenShift OAuth or Dex. Every Eclipse Che user gets a centralized developer workspace that can be easily defined, administered, and managed. As a Kubernetes-native application, Eclipse Che provides state-of-the-art monitoring and tracing capabilities, integrating with Prometheus and Grafana.
